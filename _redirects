#
# From 2019-2022, each calendar site lived at the top-level adventproject.org at its time of publication. Once the calendar ended, it was moved to a subdomain (e.g. 2019.adventproject.org).
# This means that any project URLs out there need to be retroactively redirected to their given year's subdomain. This redirects file handles that.
