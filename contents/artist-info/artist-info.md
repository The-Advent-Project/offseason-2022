# Info for Artists

Hello! We're so excited to work with you on the 2022 Calendar. As you develop your project, here are some technical and logistic details to keep in mind:

## Artwork Timeline

* **September 5:** Pitch submissions close
* **September 11:** All artists notified 
* **September 25:** Detailed outline due *(new artists only)*
* **October 9:** First draft due
* **November 6:** Second draft due
* **November 16:** Final draft due

You’ll receive feedback from an editor after each draft.

## Tech Specs

### Writing

* **File formats accepted**: Microsoft Word, Google Docs, plain text
* Maximum of 800 words

If your piece includes images or other media, please include the original media in addition to the embedded versions in your document

### Visual art

* **File formats accepted**: PNG (recommended), TIFF, JPEG (not recommended)
* **Color mode**: sRGB
* **Resolution**: At least 3000px wide or tall
* If you’re working from Illustrator or another vector app, export your files into one of the above formats

To ensure your art is accessible to everyone, please include descriptive text to accompany each image. If the text is included in an image (like for a comic), we’ll transcribe it for you—but we can’t provide descriptions for textless images.

### Audio/music

* **File formats accepted**: WAV, AIFF
* **Bit depth & sample rate**: 24-bit, 44.1 kHz or higher
* When exporting, leave all compression, limiting, normalization, and other post-processing off your output track

### Video

* **File format**: H.264 (.mp4)
* **Audio format**: AAC, 48 kHz
* **Resolution**: At least 1280×720
* If you’re exporting from Adobe Premiere, use the *Match Source - High Bitrate* preset
* If your video uses sound, please transcribe it or send us your script so we can include captions

While a soundtrack is not strictly required for a video, many viewers expect there to be sound when viewing videos online. Talk to your editor if you have questions about how to approach the audio in your video.

### Interactive

If you build your interactive using a 3rd-party service—like a slideshow or quiz builder—make sure the service allows embedding, and include the embed code when you send your draft(s).

**Developing your own interactive from scratch?** We love custom interactive pieces! Talk to your editor about how you’ll be building it, and any libraries or toolkits you’ll be using. That will help us make sure you end up with a final piece that works with The Advent Project’s platform and aligns with your creative vision.

## Third-Party Materials

If you plan to use any third-party materials—like stock music, sound effects, or video—make sure you secure the rights to use them. You may have to pay for a license or credit the author.

Not sure about something? It's better to check before making the material a big part of your project. Ask your editor if you have any questions.

<aside>

⚠️ Many free sources still require attribution to use. For example, sounds from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) usually require crediting the original artist with a link. Trust us: Don't get stuck tracking down the source for *FryingPanClang_04.wav* the night before submission.
