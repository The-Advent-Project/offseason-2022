# Info for Artists

Hello! We're so excited to work with you on the 2024 Advent Project. As you develop your piece, here are some technical and logistic details to keep in mind:

## Artwork Timeline

* **October 27**: Rough draft due
* **November 15**: Final draft due

You’ll receive feedback from one of the producers after your draft.

## Tech Specs

### Writing

* **File formats accepted**: Microsoft Word, Google Docs, plain text
* Maximum of 800 words

If your piece includes images or other media, please include the original media *in addition* to the embedded versions in your document.

### Visual art

* **File formats accepted**: PNG (recommended), TIFF, JPEG (not recommended)
* **Color mode**: sRGB
* **Resolution**: At least 3000px wide or tall
* If you’re working from Illustrator or another vector app, export your files into one of the above formats

To ensure your art is accessible to everyone, **please include descriptive text** to accompany each image. If the text is included in an image (like for a comic), we’ll transcribe it for you—but we can’t provide descriptions for textless images.

### Audio/music

* **File formats accepted**: wav, aiff, mp3 (not recommended)
* **Bit depth & sample rate**: 16-bit, 44.1 kHz or higher

When exporting, **leave all compression, limiting, normalization, and other effects off** your output/2-bus track.

### Video

* **File format**: H.264 (.mp4)
* **Audio format**: AAC, 48 kHz
* **Resolution**: At least 1280×720
* If you’re exporting from Adobe Premiere, use the *Match Source - High Bitrate* preset
* If your video uses sound, please transcribe it or send us your script so we can include captions

While a soundtrack is not strictly required for a video, **many viewers expect sound when watching a video**. Talk to a producer if you have questions about how to approach the audio in your video.

## Third-Party Materials

If you plan to use any third-party materials—like stock music, sound effects, or video—make sure you secure the rights to use them. You may have to pay for a license or credit the author.

Not sure about something? It's better to check before making the material a big part of your project. Ask a producer if you have any questions.

⚠️ Many free sources still require attribution to use. For example, sounds from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) usually require crediting the original artist with a link. Trust us: Don't get stuck tracking down the source for *FryingPanClang_04.wav* the night before submission.
