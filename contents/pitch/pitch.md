#### Every winter, The Advent Project calendar reaches hundreds of people who want to benefit a good cause and open something nice together.

Last year, we raised **$3,311** to support Grassroots Global Justice Alliance in their fight for climate justice. In previous years, we’ve raised thousands of dollars for organizations like The Community Justice Exchange and the National Center for Youth Law.  

All of this was made possible by the artists who created brand-new, bite-sized multimedia art for the calendar. And this year, you could be one of those artists! 

Artwork pitches for the December 2022 calendar must be submitted by **11:59 PM PST on Monday, September 5, 2022**.


## Questions

### What makes an Advent Project piece?

An ideal Advent Project piece is

* able to be consumed in under five minutes,
* any media or tone,
* brand-new or in the very early stages of development, and
* loosely tied to winter or a holiday that takes place in the winter.

We particularly love work that is cross-media, collaborative, and reflective of diverse backgrounds and holiday traditions. (We borrow the term "advent" and the calendar format from the Christmas tradition, but the project itself is not bound to any particular religion or holiday.) Art that has been published elsewhere (including elsewhere on the internet) is not eligible.

If this sounds like a good home for the tiny piece of weird and/or wonderful art that's been living in the back of your brain, please pitch us your idea!


### Where do the proceeds of the calendar go?

Anyone who submits a pitch gets to vote on the category of charity that the calendar will support this year. Selected artists will vote to chose one charity from a shortlist in that category, and all proceeds from the calendar will go to that charity. If you create work for the calendar, thank you in advance for donating your time and your art.


### What will I need to fill out this submission form?

If you are an artist who has not previously created work for the calendar, we will ask you for the following info:

* Your name
* The media type for your idea (sound, visual art, interactive, etc.)
* A 2–3 sentence summary of what you intend to make
* A summary of your creative background or links to your other work 
* Any samples that would give us a better sense of what you’re going for *(optional upload)*

### If my pitch is accepted, who creates the piece?

You do! So make sure that what you’re pitching is something you (or you and your chosen collaborators) can achieve on your own. But if your pitch is selected, you'll be paired with an editor who can answer creative and technical questions, and help you get your piece over the finish line.


### What's the timeline?

* **September 5:** Pitch submissions close
* **September 11:** All artists notified 
* **September 25:** Detailed outline due *(new artists only)*
* **October 9:** First draft due
* **November 6:** Second draft due
* **November 16:** Final draft due

You’ll receive feedback from an editor after each draft.


### Do I maintain ownership of my final work?

**Yes**. You will always retain rights to work you make for the calendar. (And any pitch you submit also remains yours, even if you don't make it with us.)


### I have a rough idea, but it's not complete. Should I still pitch?

Don't worry about having every detail of a project mapped out yet, just an idea you're excited about making and know you can execute on time. If you are unsure about some parts or have a concept that could happily go in two different directions, just mention that in the submission form. We'll ask questions as needed to help you draw out your idea and see if it's a good fit for this year's Advent Project.


### Can I see some examples of work from previous calendars?

You sure can! Here’s just a few:
